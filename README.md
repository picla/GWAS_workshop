How to GWAS

## Usage
The jupyter notebooks can be used in the an executable environment by clicking the Binder badge above.

To use the notebooks locally, download the notebook(s) of choice and from that directory run

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

To make sure all required packages are installed, it's practial to create the conda environment locally.
Download environment.yml

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Click [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment) for more information on conda environments.
When conda and/or jupyter is not installed locally, we advice to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
